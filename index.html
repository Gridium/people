		<h1>Medical benefits</h1>

		<p>Gridium offers health, dental, and vision insurance to all full-time 
		employees and their dependents.</p>
		
		<p>To see details of the plans and also determine costs for you and your 
		dependents, please see Gridium's <a href="https://secure.zenefits.com/benefitsPreview?token=b0821139-dd45-4e37-b18d-88e510a59e1e" target="_blank">
		Benefits Preview</a> on Zenefits. This site allows 
		to enter some basic demographic information to determine premium costs. It also
		contains links to plan summaries:</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://secure.zenefits.com/benefitsPreview?token=b0821139-dd45-4e37-b18d-88e510a59e1e" target="_blank">
		https://secure.zenefits.com/benefitsPreview?token=b0821139-dd45-4e37-b18d-88e510a59e1e</a> </p>

		<p>The benefits preview is available to everyone, including job applicants.</p>

		<h2>Health insurance</h2>

		<p>Our health insurance is through <a href="https://www.blueshieldca.com/" target="_blank"> 
		Blue Shield California</a>, 
		which is available to anyone in the United States, regardless of location.</p>
		
		<p>We offer two PPO plans, a Gold and a Platinum. Platinum offers more generous
		benefits (such as lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket limits) 
		but comes with higher premiums. You'll need to compare the plans yourself
		to decide which makes more sense for you, but in general Platinum is for people 
		who know that they will consume a lot of health care, in which case the more
		generous benefits offset the higher premiums.</p>
		
		<p>Some additional details:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Gridium covers 100% of the cost of the premium for the Gold plan. 
				Employees who choose the Platinum plan must cover the difference
				in premiums between the two plans.</li>
			<li>Gridium covers 50% of the health insurance premium for dependents. Dependents include
				children, spouses, and domestic partners.</li>
			<li>Gridium offers an additional $1,500 benefit to defray the cost of
				your deductible. See details on the Health Reimbursement Account below.</li>
			<li>Employees become eligible for health insurance on the first day of the 
			    month following the hire date. For example, if your start date is June 15, 
			    then your insurance coverage will start on July 1.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Dental insurance</h2>

		<p>Our dental insurance is a PPO plan provided by Guardian CA. Some details:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Gridium covers 75% of the cost of the premium for employees.</li>
			<li>The plan is available for dependents. Gridium does not 
			    cover premium costs for dependents.</li>
			<li>Employees become eligible for dental insurance on the first day of the 
			    month following 30 days of employment. For example, if your start date is June 15, 
			    then your dental coverage will start on August 1.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Vision insurance</h2>

		<p>Our vision insurance is a PPO plan provided by Guardian CA. Some details:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Gridium covers 75% of the cost of the premium for employees.</li>
			<li>The plan is available for dependents. Gridium does not 
			    cover premium costs for dependents.</li>
			<li>Employees become eligible for vision insurance on the first day of the 
			    month following 30 days of employment. For example, if your start date is June 15, 
			    then your dental coverage will start on August 1.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Health Reimbursement Account</h2>

		<p>Gridium offers all employees a health reimbursement account, which works
		   very much like a flexible spending account. Funds are deposited into your
		   HRA account, and you can then use those funds to reimburse yourself for
		   approved medical expenses.</p>
		
		<p>The difference between an HRA and an FSA is the source of the funds: unlike an
		FSA, which you fund with pre-tax money from your paycheck, Gridium funds your HRA 
		account with $1,500 annually. So basically: free money.</p>
		
		<p>The intent of the HRA is to help offset the deductible of our insurance plans,
		   although of course you are free to use the HRA funds however you want.</p>
		
		<p>Like an FSA, HRAs are "use it or lose it." Any funds left in the account at the
		end of the year revert to Gridium. So use it!</p>
			
		<h2>Flexible Spending Account</h2>

		<p>FSAs are medical reimbursement accounts that you fund from your paycheck. The
		advantage of an FSA is that the funds are deposited <em>pre-tax</em>, which 
		means that they are not subject to income tax. </p>
		
		<p>The disadvantage of an FSA is that the money is "use it or lose it." If you don't 
		use the funds, only a small amount can roll over to the next year. So it's important 
		to only deposit funds that you know you will be able to use.</p>
		
		<p>Gridium offers both a medical FSA and a dependent care FSA. The dependent care
		FSA can be a great way to help defray regular expenses such as a nanny for a child
		or nursing care for an elderly relative.</p>
		
		<p>Contribution limits and eligible expenses are determined by Congress and the IRS,
		so do research prior to setting up your FSA.</p>

		<h1>401(k)</h1>
		
		<p>Gridium offers a 401(k) to all full-time employees. We also match up to 4%
		of your salary. The match is free money &ndash; you should take it!</p>

		<p>There is no vesting period on the 401(k) or the match. All full-time employees 
		are eligible for the benefit starting on their first day.</p>

		<p>Our 401(k) provider is <a href="https://myubiquity.com/" target="_blank">
		Ubiquity</a>, a firm we chose because they offer a good
		combination of low fees and high-quality investment options.</p>

		<p>Please note that the 401(k) match funds are deposited after the end of the 
		calendar year. For example, the matching funds for 2022 contributions are
		deposited in 2023. If you leave Gridium before the match is deposited, you forfeit
		the match.</p>

		<p>We don't offer a Roth option at this time.</p>

		<h1>Vacation</h1>
		
		<p>Gridium has a flexible vacation policy: take off the time you need to be
		happy and productive. </p>

		<p>Flexible vacation policies have sometimes been criticized on the grounds that 
		employees don't actually take advantage of them. We don't have that problem at Gridium. 
		Most employees take between four and six weeks off in total each year, although
		of course the numbers vary (because the policy is flexible).</p>

		<p>A lot of Gridium employees are parents, and we find that allowing flexible 
		schedules is especially useful for people with kids at home. (We've been
		fully remote for over ten years, so this isn't just a pandemic thing.)</p>

	<div class="container">
		<h1>Parental leave</h1>
		
		<p>In the first year after the birth of adoption of a child, Gridium employees
		can take off up to four weeks of paid leave and an additional eight weeks of 
		unpaid leave. The time off doesn't need to be taken consecutively &ndash;
		new parents can break it up however they want during the first year after
		the arrival of their child.</p>

		<p>The policy applies to all employees, regardless of gender.</p>

	</div>

<section id="six">
	<div class="container">
		<h1>Camp</h1>
		
		<p>Camp is a quarterly in-person, whole-company meet-up. We've been putting camp 
		together for about ten years now, which means we've got about forty camps under our
		collective belt. Forty camps!</p>

		<p>We've tinkered with the formula over the years, but at its core camp has 
		remained pretty consistent: we pick a fun city to travel to and then spend three
		days working, socializing, and recreating.</p>

		<p>Popular camp destinations include New Orleans, Breckenridge, Denver, Chicago, 
		San Diego, Los Angeles, Austin, Park City, etc. (During the winter, the 
		midwesterners tend to want to go somewhere warm, natch.)</p>

		<p>Camp is very much a DIY affair. Before each camp, we issue a call for sessions.
		Anyone can propose a session, anyone can lead a session, and all are 
		encouraged to do so. Camp is an especially good time for cross-team collaboration
		with people you might not work with on a day-to-day basis.</p>

		<p>A number of traditions have grown up around camp. For example, we almost always have a round 
		of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)" target="_blank">Ignite 
		sessions</a>, and all new employees are required to give a talk. (Most people opt
		for the 10-slide format, which is a bit more forgiving than the 20-slide version.)</p>

		<p>As the company grows, we will continue to adjust the format of camp. We are 
		getting to the point where it is becoming challenging to stuff the entire company
		into Airbnbs. Change is a-comin'.</p>

		<p>But regardless what form camp takes, it will continue to serve as a focal point
		on the calendar and a great way to connect with team mates.</p>
